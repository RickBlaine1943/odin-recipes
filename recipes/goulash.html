    <h1>Goulash</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Goulash originated in medieval Hungary, where it was first prepared by herdsmen—so you know it’s bound to be hearty and filling. Traditional goulash is typically made with larger chunks of beef and vegetables that cook low and slow together for hours until the meat becomes tender. Our version is simplified but no less flavorful: onions, garlic, and three forms of tomato come together to season the beef, and because the pasta cooks in the skillet, it’s infused with the tomato and beef broth from the very beginning. A cup of cheddar cheese melted in at the end seals the deal on the flavor package. If you’re eating with friends, the pot will be empty before you can go back for more.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</ul>
    <ul>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</ul>
    <ul>2 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
    <ul>1 lb. ground beef</ul>
    <ul>Kosher salt</ul>
    <ul>Freshly ground black pepper</ul>
    <ul>1 tbsp. tomato paste</ul>
    <ul>1 1/4 c. low-sodium beef broth</ul>
    <ul>1 (15-oz.) can tomato sauce</ul>
    <ul>1 tsp. Italian seasoning</ul>
    <ul>1 tsp. paprika</ul>
    <ul>1 1/2 c. elbow macaroni, uncooked</ul>
    <ul>1 c. shredded cheddar</ul>
    <ul>Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish</ul>
    
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more.</ol>
    <ol>Add ground beef and cook until no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Drain fat and return to pan. Season with salt and pepper.</ol>
    <ol>Add tomato paste and stir to coat, then pour in broth, tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes. Season with Italian seasoning and paprika, and stir in macaroni. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, about 15 minutes.
    <ol>Stir in cheese and remove from heat.</ol>
    <ol>Garnish with parsley before serving.</ol>
